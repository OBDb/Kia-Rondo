generations:
  - name: "First Generation (UN)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The Kia Rondo (sold as the Carens in many international markets) was introduced to North America as a compact MPV, offering three-row seating in a relatively small footprint. Featuring a tall wagon-like design with a focus on maximizing interior space, it occupied a niche between traditional wagons and larger minivans. Powered by either a 2.4L four-cylinder or 2.7L V6 engine in the North American market, paired with a four-speed or five-speed automatic transmission. Available in five or seven-seat configurations, it emphasized practicality with flexible seating arrangements, numerous storage compartments, and a relatively low load floor. The interior was straightforward and functional, with durable materials and available features including a premium audio system, sunroof, and heated seats on higher trims. Safety features included standard stability control, anti-lock brakes, and six airbags. This generation established the Rondo as a practical, value-oriented family vehicle that delivered impressive space efficiency, though it was discontinued in the North American market after 2010 due to declining sales in the small MPV segment."

  - name: "Second Generation (RP, Not Sold in North America)"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The second-generation Rondo (marketed globally as the Carens) featured more sophisticated, European-influenced styling under the direction of Peter Schreyer, with sleeker proportions and Kia's signature 'tiger nose' grille. Though not sold in North America, it continued in Europe, Asia, and other international markets as a compact MPV. Available in five or seven-seat configurations, it maintained its focus on space efficiency and practicality. Engine options varied by market but typically included a range of gasoline and diesel four-cylinders, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology, offering features like a touchscreen infotainment system, panoramic sunroof, and advanced safety systems. This generation elevated the model's positioning with more premium design and features, competing effectively with established compact MPVs in markets where the segment remained popular. As consumer preferences shifted increasingly toward SUVs and crossovers, the Carens was eventually discontinued in most European markets, though it continued longer in some Asian regions."

  - name: "Third Generation (KY, Not Sold in North America)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The current generation (still called Carens globally) has been reimagined as a three-row crossover rather than a traditional MPV, reflecting changing consumer preferences. Designed primarily for markets like India and parts of Asia where three-row vehicles remain popular, it features SUV-inspired styling with a bold front end, muscular proportions, and increased ground clearance. Available in six or seven-seat configurations, it maintains the practicality focus of its predecessors with flexible seating arrangements and numerous convenience features. Engine options vary by market but typically include modern four-cylinder gasoline and diesel units, some with turbocharging for improved efficiency and performance. The interior represents a major advancement with more upscale design, higher quality materials, and advanced technology including a 10.25-inch touchscreen, digital instrument cluster, and comprehensive connectivity options. Safety has been emphasized with Kia's suite of driver assistance features available on higher trims. Although not sold in North America (where the Rondo name has been retired), this generation adapts the Carens concept for the crossover-dominated modern market while maintaining its focus on practicality, value, and family-friendly features."
